# Topic Service

The topic service manages anything having to do with topics that a trainer wants to do.  It handles requests from the front-end using controllers, performs business logic to convert the requests in the java bean using services, and updates/queries the database using repositories.  Beans include Batch, Subtopic, SubtopicName, SubtopicStatus, SubtopicStatus, SubtopicType, TopicName, and TopicWeek.  Each bean represents a table in the Topic Service database.
